As part of our coursework under the guidance of Prof. Mehrdad Sharif Bakhtiar, 
we embarked on the project of designing a MOS-based amplifier.
The amplifier was constructed of 2 stages: (1) differential inputted folded cascode, (2 ) common source as output stage.
The goal of this amplifier design was achieving an A_vd of 100dB and a swing of Â±0.75V, operating solely on a V_dd of 1.8V.
